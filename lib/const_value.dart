    We Will represent you the App which provide you the Graphical user interface for better understanding about how to maintain specific network using this App. With the help of this app u are good-to-go even you are beginner or advanced understanding of network interface or how network will work.
    
This app is basically, characterize with some features use for knowing every detail in every efficient and easy manner.

There are total 6 different features
1) System section
2) Scanning section
3) Log Files section
4) Added Rules section
5) Alert section
6) Help and Report section

  HOW TO USE, This section in efficient mannner:::
  
	1) System Section  : 
			This section generally has a graph plotation use for showing how far CPU uitilization are on-going with all 8-core, Which are basiclyshow the uitilization of cpu or memory is different uses providing by user. IF the graph having larger curve created then this means the cpu are too busy with ongoing process which are not good sign for the network as well  there may be the chances of DOS or D-DOS Attack, so it will provide you real-time working of cpu uitilization and memory usage in that.
				
	2) Scanning :
			In this Section, The Scanning process are done using snort application which provide network intrusion dection and prevention system for network using specific kind of packet filtering , or signature-based or many more. So, Scanning will give you the ongoing scanning on network for safety purpose. IF,there is any threat detected than it will send alert file to next section which are alert section.
			
	3) Ports : 
			In This Section, We will provide you the information about the network that which ports are open in given specific network,so It will we easy that will know that on what port attack are possible and which port are not secure and according to that will we create the rules to provide the security on that specific ports.
			
	4) Log Files : 
			It Will we necessary that analysis of log files which provide many data about how to, what to, why to, the given data or packet will we there, what are the specific lenght of packet,time-to-live for the packet and many more for the analysis of log files. In this Section Will we provide you different type of time and date for finding specific type of log files on a given date as well.
			
	5) Added Rules :
			As, our app will provide all type of rule to provide security for your specific network interface but it will we always good to create your customize rules with different message on what you want to give security on any specific port e.x.:: like you are wise to provide network security on port no. 21 for FTP and show msg like hey, someone try to access data or try to connect from ports no 21 . then this will possible with the customize rule.
			
	6) Alert : 
			This Section is usually like a notification on whatsapp when someone try to scan on  your network so it will provide you an alert with given specific type of message Including ip address of attacker or scanner with proper time and date. help you out for know that yes someone try to attacker on our network.
